## Description
The application's primary goal is to assist users in maintaining their personal to-do lists effectively by categorizing tasks into projects, promoting improved productivity. It includes a specific tab for users to concentrate on tasks scheduled for today. In the words of David Allen, "The mind is for having ideas, not holding them."

This app provides the user the ability to do the following:
- Create new projects
- Create tasks within a specific project
- Delete any user created project
- Complete any task
- Modify any task
- Sort the taks based on priorities and due dates
- View all the tasks that are due today
- All of the user inputted information is encoded in JSON format and decoded whenever it is necessary
